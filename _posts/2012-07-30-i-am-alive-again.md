Hi guys! Do you still remember me? Did you miss me? I am the *Guest from Mountains*. I have been away for months. But I am back alive now, with a brand new face!

I have changed not only the face, but also my blood and bones. No more WordPress, no more database, no more PHP, but Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The RSS Feed URL does not change: <http://feeds.feedburner.com/xiaoyong> (or <http://feeds2.feedburner.com/xiaoyong> if you are blocked). Please help check whether it works.

Even though nowadays MicroBlog (my little cousin --) is prevailing, I am not worrying about being abandoned. Because I believe that what matters is always the content, not the style.

Just wanna make a howl to mark my new life. Over.
